# Diamond Price Prediction
Prepare to be dazzled by my participation in ShAI's Kaggle competition, where I embarked on an exhilarating quest to predict diamond prices.Through meticulous exploration of diverse models and strategic utilization of pipelines,ultimately discovering the holy grail of performance and securing an unprecedented high score in the quest to predict diamond prices
# Data:
The model is trained and tested on the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diamond-price-prediction/data).This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. There are 10 features in the dataset including the target variable. Some of the Features:

Carat : is the diamond’s physical weight.
Cut : Describe cut quality of the diamond. The values of this feature are Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal; the more precise the diamond is cut, the more captivating the diamond is to the eye.
